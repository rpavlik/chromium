Before July Alpha release:
	DrawPixels/RasterPos 
		Rasterpos sort of works; needs to be tested on multiple tiles
	tilesort Viewport testing 
		Quake III should do it
	tilesort Pinching 
		need a vertex counting API
	GM support 
		can't test without a switch -- DAMMIT!
	Parallel applications
		Debug parallel test application (server runs out of memory quick)
		Test context switching code
		context switching for pushattrib stack -- yuck
	Documentation
		How to run
		How to configure
		How to write a SPU
		Code organization

Before October release:
	ReadPixels
		let's get it right this time, OK?
	PushAttrib/PopAttrib
		framework already there
	Tilesort display lists
		broadcast definitions for now
	Tilesort evaluators
		this should be easy, right?
	Readback SPU
		Simple
	Binary Swap SPU
		Brian?
	State altering SPU
		Fun hack
	DirectShow SPU
		Matt Everett's stuff
	Lightning-2 server support
		Oh God
	Lightning-2 depth sort SPU
		Oh Sweet Jesus
	VTK support
		Zak?  This new guy coming in fall?  Probably me.
	Tee SPU
		Easy.  Is this still useful with the print SPU? 
	Hinting
	Parameter setting in the CM
		Straightforward, but probably a *lot* of things to check
		at startup.
	CM auto application startup
		Easy -- need to do something about Windows though
		Start in reverse-topsort-order
	NVIDIA extensions
		Chris is hacking away...
	Compression (color, normal, vertex, image (?))
		Color/Normal easy, Vertex more complex but we have the code somewhere
	Package demo applications
		Terrain viewer (Zak)
		NVIDIA apps (Chris)

Future:
	OS ports?
		MacOS X -- Chris
	Byte-swapping
		New packer?
	VIA port
		Vasily said he'd do this a long time ago, but looks doubtful
	Display list state changes
		Store buffer of state-changing commands and re-decode them on
			the client side when a list is called?
		Collapse non-state changing things (notice PushMatrix/PopMatrix pairs)
	More efficient Vertex Array support
		Ian expressed some interest in this
