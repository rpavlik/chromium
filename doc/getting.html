<h1 class="PageHeading">Getting Chromium</h1>

<p>Chromium is maintained at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/chromium">SourceForge</a>.&nbsp;
In addition to the source code, you'll also find a bug tracking system and three
mailing lists.&nbsp; Even if you're not a developer, you may wish to subscribe
to chromium-announce to receive information about updated releases.</p>

<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Obtaining source code</h2>

<p>To get the source code, you do <i>not</i> have to be a registered SourceForge
user.&nbsp; You can get the source in one of two ways:</p>
<p>First, you can download the latest release, which is available
from the <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/chromium">main
project page</a>, under <b>Latest File Releases</b>.
This will be a
gzip'ed tar file of the entire source tree on the release date, along with a
copy of this documentation.&nbsp; Simply extract the archive and you've got
everything.  For example:</p>
<pre>
      tar zxvf cr-1.5.tar.gz
</pre>
or
<pre>
      gzcat cr-1.5.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</pre>

<p>Alternately, you can check out the top-of-tree source code from the CVS
repository, if you want to live on the bleeding edge.&nbsp;
To check out the source code, just follow the instructions on the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=16529">CVS repository
page</a>.&nbsp; If you're unfamiliar with CVS, useful documentation is
available in <i><a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html">Open Source
Development with CVS</a></i>.
If you want to track the CVS sources you should subscribe to the developers
and CVS check-in <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=16529">
mailing lists</a>.  That's where new development is discussed.
</p>



<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Compiling the source</h2>

<p>All of Chromium lives under a directory called &quot;<code>cr</code>&quot;.&nbsp; Change
to that directory, and type &quot;<code>make</code>&quot;.&nbsp; You will need <a href="http://www.python.org">Python
2.2</a> or later, and <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl 5.0</a> or later to
build on any platform.&nbsp; Binaries are put in <code> cr/bin/&lt;ARCH&gt;</code>, where
<code>
&lt;ARCH&gt;</code> is the name of your architecture (Actually, it's what's
returned by the &quot;<code>uname</code>&quot; command.&nbsp; Except on
Windows, where <a href="http://cygwin.com/">cygwin's</a>
&quot;<code>uname</code>&quot; returns something long and silly, so it gets
re-written to &quot;<code>WIN_NT</code>&quot;.).&nbsp; You should add this
directory to your <code>PATH</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you do not have <a href="http://www.myri.com/scs/index.html">Myrinet
GM libraries</a>, you should turn off GM support in the file <code>cr/util/Makefile</code>
before building.&nbsp; There are instructions in that file.</p>

<p>NOTE: A few compile-time options can be specified in the
<code>options.mk</code> file.  DMX support and threadsafety options are
specified in this file, for example.
<p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>
You'll need GLUT installed so that the demonstration programs will compile.
</p>


<p>Platform specific notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Any UNIX</b>: Shared libraries will be put in the directory <code> cr/lib/&lt;ARCH&gt;</code>.
    You will need to add this directory to your <code> LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment
    variable.&nbsp; Chromium builds a <i>lot</i> of shared libraries, so you
    can't skip this step.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Windows</b>:&nbsp; You will also need to install the <a href="http://cygwin.com/">cygwin
    tools</a> to build Chromium.&nbsp; If you're building from the Windows shell
    (as opposed to the cygwin bash implementation), you will need to set the
    environment variable &quot;<code>MAKE_MODE</code>&quot; to the string &quot;<code>unix</code>&quot;.&nbsp;
    This lets <code>gmake</code> use <code> bash</code> as its subshell instead of the Windows shell,
    which is required.&nbsp; Shared libraries on Windows get put in <code>cr/bin/WIN_NT</code>,
    which (since it's on your path, right?) will be searched automatically, so
    there's no <code> LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> silliness.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>IRIX</b>:&nbsp; GNU make is required.  Build Chromium by typing
    <code>gmake</code> instead of <code>make</code>.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>AIX</b>:&nbsp;
    Shared libraries are somewhat different on this platform.  For Cr clients
    and servers to run, a dlopen-able system GL is needed.  At present, do this
    (once) manually (ar -x /usr/lib/libGL.a && mv shr.o libGL.o ) . Set
    CR_SYSTEM_GL_PATH to the directory with libGL.o  for AIX clients and
    servers.
    <br>
    The exec loader will continue to look for .a's (rather, shared objects in
    ar archives) and .so's.  So to run clients without the app_faker, prepend
    LIBPATH with a dir that has a link libGL.a ->  lib/AIX/libcrfaker.a . As
    with other platforms, you also need to set the CR_APPLICATION_ID_NUMBER.
    </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>SunOS</b>:&nbsp;
    OpenGL apps must be compiled with SUN_OGL_NO_VERTEX_MACROS defined so
    that macros aren't used for OpenGL API functions.
    This also means that Sun's stock GLUT and GLU libraries won't work with
    Chromium.
    After you've produced new GLUT and GLU libraries you may have to edit
    SunOS.mk and modify your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to select the new libraries.
    <br>
    There seems to be a bug in the version of Xsun that comes with Solaris 9.
    To go around it set SOLARIS_9_X_BUG. Even if you're compiling say the
    Linux version but are using a sun for the display you should set this.
    </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Darwin</b>:&nbsp;
    Support for this operating system is not complete.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Build Options</h3>

<p>
See the cr/options.mk file for some configuration options which control
thread safety, debug vs release, DMX support, etc.
