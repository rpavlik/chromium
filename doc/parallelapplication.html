<p>The Chromium server can serialize multiple incoming streams from a
distributed OpenGL application.&nbsp; Here we will build a trivial parallel
application using Chromium.&nbsp; The application that we will be considering is
called psubmit, and can be found in the directory <code>cr/progs/psumit</code>.</p>
<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Be Warned</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The parallel submission portion of Chromium has been tested very
    little.&nbsp; In fact, the little amount of testing I've done on this part
    of the system indicates that something is leaking memory like a sieve, so
    the runs don't last very long.&nbsp; This is my absolute #1 top priority
    thing to fix after the alpha release, so if you care about this, stay tuned
    to the chromium-users mailing list.</li>
  <li>The semantics of writing parallel applications haven't been completely
    thought through.&nbsp; For example, a sort-first parallel program from
    WireGL will port trivially to a sort-first parallel Chromium program, but if
    you wrote a sort-last SPU and wanted to run the same application, it might
    require (very minor) changes to some calls.&nbsp; I'm going to work on
    pushing this logic into the mothership so the same application will run
    sort-first or sort-last (assuming that it doesn't need the additional
    ordering provided by sort-first) without modification or recompilation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="PageSubHeading">The Basic Idea</h2>
<p>Writing a parallel OpenGL application is pretty simple.&nbsp; You have a
bunch of processes, each one of which is responsible for a portion of the model
to be rendered.&nbsp; Each process renders its portion pretty much as if it were
the only process in the world.&nbsp; The differences come up when you have
requirements about the <i>ordering</i> of command execution.</p>
<p>OpenGL provides <i>ordered semantics</i>.&nbsp; That means that if function A
is called after function B, the resulting image should look as if A happened
before B.&nbsp; With parallel programs, it's no longer clear which function is
getting called first.&nbsp; Therefore, if you aren't using the depth test (for
example), and you draw two overlapping triangles in parallel, you don't know
which one will appear on top.&nbsp; To get around this problem, Chromium
implements the parallel API proposed by <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/parallel_api/" target="new_window">Igehy,
Stoll and Hanrahan in SIGGRAPH '98</a>.&nbsp; This API extends OpenGL to have
barriers and semaphores, which are sufficient to express almost all ordering
constraints that come up in graphics.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the <code>main</code> function of <code>psubmit.c</code>
in <code>cr/progs/psubmit</code>.&nbsp; The first thing this function does is
determines how many of its peers exist, and which instance number (starting from
0) this particular <code>main</code> is running in.&nbsp; In <code>psubmit</code>,
this is done with command line arguments, although more complex programs will
probably need to do some sort of application-level communication or
synchronization and would get this information from, say, MPI.</p>
<p>Once the rank and size of the program are determined, the following two lines
appear:</p>

<table width="100%" height="35"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing" height="31">		crCreateContext();<br>
	crMakeCurrent();</td></tr></table>

<p>These calls, declared in the header file &quot;<code>cr_applications.h</code>&quot;,
provide a mechanism to initialize the Chromium system without creating a
window.&nbsp; This is particularly useful for parallel applications, since it
doesn't really make sense to have a bunch of blank faked-out windows popping up
all over the cluster.&nbsp; This also means that the client nodes in the cluster
do not have to have a graphical environment running just to house a blank
faked-out window.</p>

<p>The next thing that the application does is create a GL barrier:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">		glBarrierCreate( MASTER_BARRIER, size );</td></tr></table>

<p>Notice that every node in the cluster will create this barrier.&nbsp; This is
perfectly legal, as long as the &quot;size&quot; parameter matches up.&nbsp; <code>MASTER_BARRIER</code>
is just an integer that &quot;names&quot; this barrier, much like an OpenGL
display list or texture object (except that the namespace is shared between
clients by default).</p>
<p>Next comes the main drawing loop.&nbsp; This application follows the basic
format of all simple parallel OpenGL applications:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">		for (;;)<br>
      {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (rank == 0) glClear(...);<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glBarrierExec( MASTER_BARRIER );<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Drawing code here<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glBarrierExec( MASTER_BARRIER );<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (rank == 0) crSwapBuffers();<br>
      }</td></tr></table>

<p>A few things to note about this drawing method:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Only rank 0 is doing a clear and a swap.&nbsp; This makes sense for
    sort-first applications, but is one of the ways in which this application
    would not work in a sort-last configuration.&nbsp; It is likely that this
    logic will move into the SPUs themselves (i.e., the SPU's will know whether
    or not to pay attention to a call to <code>glClear</code>) in the future.</li>
  <li><code>glBarrierExec</code> (also declared in <code>cr_applications.h</code>)
    is the call to enter a barrier.</li>
  <li>The barrier following the clear ensures that the clear has happened before
    <i>anyone</i> starts drawing</li>
  <li>The barrier preceding the swap ensures that <i>everyone</i> is finished
    drawing before the buffers are swapped</li>
  <li>Barriers (and semaphores) do <i>not</i> block the application.&nbsp; They
    simply indicate ordering constraints to be obeyed by the server when
    switching contexts.&nbsp; Therefore, the clients do not have to stall, and
    can get ahead of the servers.</li>
</ul>
