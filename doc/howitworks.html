      How Chromium Works
    </h1>
    <p>
      This document is intended to give an overview of how the various pieces
      of Chromium work and what's going on behind the scenes when you do one of
      these runs.&nbsp; It will probably be a grab-bag of useful nuggets of
      information in no particular order.&nbsp; Hopefully this will be useful
      if someone wants to experiment with changing some part of the core
      architecture instead of just extending it.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      The Mothership
    </h2>
    <p>
      The mothership is usually the first thing that you will run for any
      Chromium session.&nbsp; We've already described in detail how the scripts
      themselves work, so let's focus on the mothership itself.&nbsp; The guts
      of the mothership are invoked by the "<code class="Function">Go</code>"
      method of the <code class="Class">CR</code> objects created in a
      configuration script.&nbsp; The last line of a Chromium configuration
      script will almost always be:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      cr.Go()
    </p>
    <p>
      This function actually takes a single argument: the port to listen
      on.&nbsp; The default port is 10000, but it can sometimes be useful to
      have the port be an argument to the script if, for example, sockets take
      a minute to shut down properly (like they can on Linux).&nbsp; The
      <code class="Function">Go</code> method will create a socket on the
      specified port, and accept connections from (possibly multiple
      simultaneous) clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mothership then calls <code class="Function">ProcessRequest</code>,
      which will read a single line of data from the connected client.&nbsp;
      This line is split into words: the first word is considered to be a
      command, and the rest of the words are arguments to that command.&nbsp;
      So, for example, you can connect to the mothership (just telnet to port
      10000) and send the following line:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      spu 10
    </p>
    <p>
      This will be broken by the mothership into the words "spu" and
      "10".&nbsp; Then, the Python script will build an on-the-fly reference to
      a method of the <code class="Class">CR</code> class, using Python's
      reflection API.&nbsp; This is done by the following lines of <code class=
      "Function">ProcessRequest</code> in <span class=
      "File">mothership/server/mothership.py</span>:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      command = string.lower( words[0] )<br>
      print "command = " + command<br>
      try:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fn = getattr(self, 'do_%s' % command )<br>
      except AttributeError:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.ClientError( sock_wrapper,
      SockWrapper.UNKNOWNCOMMAND, "Unknown command: %s" % command )<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return<br>
      fn( sock_wrapper, string.join( words[1:] ) )
    </p>
    <p>
      The "<code class="Function">getattr</code>" function tries to find a
      method called, in our example "<code class=
      "Function">do_spu</code>".&nbsp; If the method is not found, an error is
      returned to the calling client.&nbsp; Errors are reported with a
      three-digit numeric code and a descriptive string.&nbsp; In this case,
      the code <code>SockWrapper.UNKNOWNCOMMAND</code> happens to be 402.&nbsp;
      This is a lot like the way HTTP works -- a successful reply actually has
      the ID 200.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the function <em>is</em> found, the variable "<code>fn</code>" becomes
      a handle to it, and the rest of the arguments are combined into a single
      string and passed as arguments to the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      To continue this example, let's look at the <code class=
      "Function">do_spu</code> method:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      def do_spu( self, sock, args ):<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spuid = int(args)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.ClientError( sock,
      SockWrapper.UNKNOWNSPU, "Bogus SPU name: %s" % args )<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if not allSPUs.has_key( spuid ):<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.ClientError( sock,
      SockWrapper.UNKNOWNSPU, "Never heard of SPU %d" % spuid )<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sock.SPUid = spuid<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sock.Success( "Hello, SPU!" )
    </p>
    <p>
      This method tries to convert the arguments (in our case, the single
      string "10") into an integer.&nbsp; If the conversion fails, a "Bogus SPU
      name" is returned.&nbsp; This can happen if the client says "<code>spu
      10.5</code>" or "<code>spu 10 foo</code>" or "<code>spu
      clodburger</code>".&nbsp; Next, the system tries to find the SPU from the
      given ID.&nbsp; Each SPU is assigned a unique numeric identifier by the
      mothership when it is added to a node; these identifiers are communicated
      to the application faker or the server when the SPU is loaded.&nbsp; The
      ID is then passed as the first argument to the SPU's <code class=
      "Function">SPUInit</code> function.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the SPU is found, the ID is stored along with the socket, so that
      subsequent requests on the same socket are referring to a particular
      SPU.&nbsp; This way, to get many configuration settings for a particular
      SPU, you set the "current" SPU and then send many "<code>spuparam
      &lt;param_name&gt;</code>" commands in succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mothership also has some rudimentary facilities for brokering
      out-of-band connections between components, although this is not
      completely implemented yet.&nbsp; In fact, the Myrinet implementation of
      the Chromium networking abstraction uses what does exist of this facility
      to establish its connections.&nbsp; Because Myrinet GM is a completely
      connectionless API, WireGL had to have a TCP/IP based handshake occur
      first in which the two computers agreed to use Myrinet and exchanged some
      information related to the connection.&nbsp; In Chromium, that
      information is exchanged via the mothership.&nbsp; This paragraph is
      deliberately vague because the exact mechanism is likely to change in the
      near future.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      The Server
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next portion of the system likely to get run is the Chromium
      server.&nbsp; The first thing that the server tries to do is figure out
      where the mothership is.&nbsp; This can be specified with the
      "-mothership" command line option.&nbsp; If this option is omitted, NULL
      will be passed to <code class="Function">crMothershipConnect</code>,
      which will cause the mothership library to look for the <span class=
      "EnvVar">CRMOTHERSHIP</span> environment variable, and if that fails to
      default to "<code>localhost:10000</code>".&nbsp; Notice that the format
      for specifying the location of the mothership is
      "<code>&lt;host&gt;:port</code>", although the port can be omitted.&nbsp;
      Eventually, the mothership will remotely invoke the server (and the
      application faker, which has a similar argument), so this will be a
      non-issue.&nbsp; For now, the most likely scenario is that the mothership
      will run on the same machine all the time, so you can set the
      <span class="EnvVar">CRMOTHERSHIP</span> environment variable to just the
      name of that machine.&nbsp; The mothership <em>requires</em> TCP/IP to
      work -- it can not work over GM.
    </p>
    <p>
      The server next initializes the state tracking and networking subsystems,
      and then connects to the mothership to configure itself.&nbsp; It turns
      out that the call:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      crServerGatherConfiguration( mothership );
    </p>
    <p>
      Is actually where the server will wait for clients to connect to
      it.&nbsp; Because the mothership knows the connectivity of the node
      graph, the server knows how many clients to wait for and what network
      protocol they will be using, obviating the need for the WireGL-style
      handshake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other interesting thing that happens at the configuration step is
      that the server pretends to be one of its clients for a while.&nbsp; The
      server needs to know how big the entire logical output space is (to
      properly handle <code class="Function">glViewport</code> and <code class=
      "Function">glScissor</code> calls), but the tile configuration for the
      server only tells it about its local pieces.&nbsp; So the server finds
      out the SPU id of one of its clients, "poses" as that SPU to the
      mothership, and asks to find out about all of the <em>other</em> servers
      in the current run and their tilings.&nbsp; It uses this information to
      find the server with the most extremal tile boundaries and compute the
      width and height of the entire logical output space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the server's <code class="Function">main</code>, a "base
      projection" is then computed, which allows the server to place a
      translate-and-scale matrix at the top of the projection matrix
      stack.&nbsp; This is because any screen tiling is handed by the server,
      not by an individual SPU.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, the server's dispatch table is built (analogous to, but not exactly
      the same as, the <a href="codegen.html" class="SPU">seethrough SPU</a>'s
      <code class="Function">seethroughspuBuildFunctionTable</code>
      function.&nbsp; The state tracker is told to use this function pointer
      table when it computes differences for context switching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the server enters its main loop:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      crServerSerializeRemoteStreams();
    </p>
    <p>
      This function will loop forever and dispatch remote blocks of work to the
      SPU chain that it loaded at configuration time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code class="Function">crServerSerializeRemoteStreams</code> is actually
      a pretty simple function (it's in <span class=
      "File">crserver/server_stream.c</span>).&nbsp; It gets a client off the
      run queue, makes current to that client's context (causing a context
      difference to be evaluated), and executes blocks of work for that client
      until the client blocks.&nbsp; The code is fairly self-explanatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The function at the very end of <span class=
      "File">crserver/server_stream.c</span> merits explanation:
    </p>
    <p class="GrayCodeListing2">
      int crServerRecv( CRConnection *conn, void *buf, unsigned int len )<br>
      {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(void) conn;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(void) buf;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(void) len;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 0; // Never handle anything -- let packets
      queue up per-client instead.<br>
      }
    </p>
    <p>
      When the networking library is initialized (in <code class=
      "Function">main</code>), it is passed this function as a "handler" for
      incoming packets.&nbsp; When a packet is received by the networking
      library, it makes sure that it is a valid message in the Chromium
      protocol, and then passes it immediately to the provided handler
      function.&nbsp; If the handler function does something with it, the
      function should return 1, and the message will be discarded.&nbsp; If,
      however, the handler function <em>does not</em> handle the message, it is
      passed to the default message handler.
    </p>
    <p>
      The default message handler takes care of flow-control messages,
      reassembling fragmented packets, and queueing actual blocks of OpenGL
      work.&nbsp; Since the server's receive function always returns 0, any
      work blocks that arrive at the server are queued up on a linked list
      stored inside the <code class="Class">CRConnection</code> data structure.
      So the implementation of <code class="Function">crNetGetMessage</code>
      (called from <code class=
      "Function">crServerSerializeRemoteStreams</code>) simply checks this
      queue, and if it is empty it grabs blocks from the networking library
      until a block of work arrives on the requested queue.&nbsp; In practice,
      this scheduling algorithm has proved to work well, although certainly
      more sophisticated schemes would be possible.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      The Application Faker
    </h2>
    <p>
      The application faker, or "<span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span>", is one
      of the ugly system-dependent muddy-voodoo pieces of the system that is
      probably best left alone.&nbsp; It predates WireGL all the way back to
      the early <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/pomegranate"
      target="_parent">Pomegranate</a> simulations.&nbsp; The job of
      <span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span> is to launch a child process in
      such a way that it will find the Chromium OpenGL DLL.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      On Windows, this is accomplished by creating a temporary directory,
      copying the executable there, copying <span class=
      "File">crfaker.dll</span> to that directory and renaming it as
      <span class="File">opengl32.dll</span>, spawning the executable as a
      child, and deleting the directory when the child exits.&nbsp; Of course,
      if the child crashes, the directory will not be cleaned, so beware of
      thousands of copies of things lying around in temporary directories.
    </p>
    <p>
      On UNIX, <span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span> is slightly less
      invasive.&nbsp; It creates a temporary directory and fills it with
      appropriately named symbolic links to <span class=
      "File">libcrfaker.so</span>.&nbsp; It then prepends that temporary
      directory to the <span class="EnvVar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span> environment
      variable.&nbsp; Then the executable is spawned and the directory cleaned
      up (again, unless the executable crashes).
    </p>
    <p>
      On Darwin, the process is about the same as on UNIX, but with a few extra
      steps. Due to the nature of Frameworks on Darwin, the entirety of
      OpenGL.framework has to be 'created' in order to properly fake the
      dynamic linker. Frameworks are a series of folders and symbolic links
      that contain all the OpenGL headers and binaries. The faker creates one
      similar to the actual OpenGL.framework, putting the faker library in
      where needed. The faker then prepends the framework directory to the
      <span class="EnvVar">DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH</span> before spawning the
      executable. See <code class="Funciton">make_temp_framework</code> in
      <span class="File">app_faker/app_faker.c</span> for the framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span> can also be told where the
      mothership is on the command line.&nbsp; A pointer to the faker DLL can
      be specified explicitly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span> will set an environment variable
      called <span class="EnvVar">CR_APPLICATION_ID_NUMBER</span>, which is
      used by the OpenGL faker DLL to disambiguate itself from other fakers
      that might be running on the same machine (which can happen when
      debugging parallel programs on a uniprocessor).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="CrApp">crappfaker</span> also sets an environment variable
      called <span class="EnvVar">__CR_LAUNCHED_FROM_APP_FAKER</span>, which
      SPU's can use to tell if they were loaded manually or by the app
      faker.&nbsp; This can be useful if the SPU wants to behave in a slightly
      different way, or work around a bug.&nbsp; See <span class=
      "File">spu/render/renderspu_window.c</span> for an example.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      The OpenGL Faker Library
    </h2>
    <p>
      This library, called <span class="File">crfaker.dll</span> (or
      <span class="File">libcrfaker.so</span> on UNIX and <span class=
      "File">libcrfaker.dylib</span> on Darwin), exports the OpenGL API to an
      application.&nbsp; When a context is created, the mothership is
      contacted, and a chain of SPU's is loaded.&nbsp; This all happens in the
      function <code class="Function">StubInit</code> in <span class=
      "File">opengl_stub/load.c</span>.&nbsp; Once the SPU's are loaded, the
      dispatch table from the head SPU is copied into global variables called
      "<code>__glim_FuncName</code>" (e.g., <code>__glim_Color3f</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      These variables are used to dispatch the actual OpenGL API to SPU
      functions.&nbsp; The dispatch method varies from platform to platform;
      see <span class="File">opengl_stub/Linux_exports.py</span> for the most
      complicated one.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      The SPU Loader
    </h2>
    <p>
      The SPU Loader, located in <span class="Directory">spu_loader/</span>, is
      responsible for reading a SPU DLL from disk and building a dispatch table
      for it.&nbsp; It can also load a chain of SPU's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loading a single SPU is pretty straightforward.&nbsp; The SPU DLL is
      opened explicitly using <code class="Function">crDLLOpen</code>. Then,
      the SPU's single entry point, called <code class=
      "Function">SPULoad</code>, is extracted and called.&nbsp; This returns
      several pieces of information to the loader:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The SPU's name
      </li>
      <li>The SPU's SuperSPU name
      </li>
      <li>The SPU's <code class="Function">SPUInit</code> function
      </li>
      <li>The SPU's <code class="Function">SPUSelf</code> function
      </li>
      <li>The SPU's <code class="Function">SPUCleanup</code> function
      (currently unused)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The loader will load the SuperSPU first with a recursive call to
      itself.&nbsp; Note that the loader will default to loading the
      <span class="SPU">error</span> SPU if no SuperSPU is provided (unless, of
      course, the SPU being loaded <em>is</em> the <span class=
      "SPU">error</span> SPU).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the <code class="Function">SPUInit</code> function is called.&nbsp;
      This function is passed the unique SPU ID given to this SPU by the
      mothership, a pointer to the (already built) dispatch table for the SPU
      immediately following the one being loaded in the chain (the "child"
      SPU), a pointer to its own SPU structure (from which the already-loaded
      SuperSPU can be accessed through the <code>-&gt;superSPU</code> member),
      and two more (currently unused) arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on the named function table returned (see "<a href=
      "newspu.html">Writing a new SPU</a>" and "<a href=
      "codegen.html">Automatically generating code for a SPU</a>"), the
      dispatch table is built by the function <code class=
      "Function">__buildDispatch</code>, implemented in <span class=
      "File">spu_loader/dispatch.c</span> (which is generated by <span class=
      "File">spu_loader/dispatch.py</span>).&nbsp; This function will search
      for named functions through a chain of SuperSPU's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The built dispatch table is then passed back to the SPU through the
      SPUSelf function.&nbsp; Currently, no SPUs actually use this, although
      this is a convenient way to get access to your own built dispatch table
      (including your parent's functions, where appropriate) without actually
      declaring all of your own functions as "<code>extern</code>" and calling
      them explicitly.&nbsp; This would be an improvement over the ugly
      "<code>extern</code>" function declarations used in the vertex array
      implementation in "<a href="codegen.html">Automatically generating code
      for a SPU</a>".
    </p>
    <p>
      To load a SPU chain, SPUs are simply loaded in reverse order, so we can
      pass the built dispatch table for a child to the upstream SPU.
    </p>
    <h2 class="PageSubHeading">
      The Packer
    </h2>
    <p>
      The library in <span class="Directory">packer/</span> creates buffers
      suitable for sending over a network out of the OpenGL API.&nbsp; It is
      fairly straightforward, and described in some detail in our <a href=
      "http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/clust_render" target=
      "_parent">Supercomputing 2000 paper</a>.&nbsp; However, Chromium's packer
      has some interesting quirks that are worth mentioning:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The packer doesn't interact with the state tracker at all.&nbsp;
      Therefore, in order to pack any function that requires knowledge of state
      (<code class="Function">glArrayElement</code> and <code class="Function">
        glTexImage</code> are good examples), the caller of the pack function
        must provide the relevant state structure.&nbsp; This means that the
        burden of properly dispatching things to the state tracker lies with
        the calling SPU, which is a slightly cleaner design.&nbsp; See the
        functions in <span class="File">spu/pack/packspu_pixel.c</span> for an
        example of this usage.
      </li>
      <li>If you want to maintain multiple buffers for packing (like the
      TileSort SPU does), you need to swap them in and out yourself.&nbsp; The
      packer maintains its own pointers into the global pack buffer to tell it
      where the next opcode and data elements should go.&nbsp; If you are
      switching between pack buffers, you need to extract those pointers so
      they can be properly put back when it's time to switch back again.&nbsp;
      See <span class="File">spu/tilesort/tilesortspu_flush.c</span>, and look
      for calls to <code class="Function">crPackSetBuffer</code> and
      <code class="Function">crPackGetBuffer</code>.
      </li>
      <li>There are multiple versions of the packing functions for
      vertices.&nbsp; The simple ones (e.g., <code class=
      "Function">crPackVertex3f</code>) just pack the vertex, and nothing
      more.&nbsp; There are BBOX packing functions (e.g., <code class=
      "Function">crPackVertex3fBBOX</code>) that update a geometry bounding box
      as they pack.&nbsp; This logic is in the packer instead of in the
      tilesorter for two reasons.&nbsp; First, it would be inefficient to use
      an extra function call to keep track of the bounding box on the
      side.&nbsp; Second, other SPU's may want to track bounding box
      information.&nbsp; See the initialization of the <code>bucketInfo</code>
      variable in <span class="File">spu/tilesort/tilesortspu_bucket.c</span>
      for an example of how to get at this data.&nbsp; Finally, functions are
      available that can track the bounding box <em>and</em> count the number
      of vertices (e.g., <code class=
      "Function">crPackVertex3fBBOX_COUNT</code>).&nbsp; This is used in the
      TileSort SPU when the geometry packing buffer fills up in the middle of a
      primitive, since we need to know how many vertices to save away for
      re-issuing in a future buffer.&nbsp; See <span class=
      "File">spu/tilesort/tilesortspu_pinch.c</span> (but shield your eyes,
      this code is complicated).
      </li>
      <li>The packer will use a callback function to inform the calling library
      that the buffer has filled up.&nbsp; The callback function can be set
      with <code class="Function">crPackFlushFunc</code>, and it takes a
      "<code>void *</code>" argument that can be set with <code class=
      "Function">crPackFlushArg</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>

      The Unpacker
    </h2>
    <p>
      The unpacking library is considerably simpler than the packing
      library.&nbsp; It simply walks over a packed buffer, calling the
      functions of a <code class="Class">SPUDispatchTable</code>.&nbsp; The API
      to be used is passed to the <code class="Function">crUnpack</code>
      function -- see <span class="File">crserver/server_stream.c</span> for an
      example.
    </p>
    <p>
      The server also uses features of the unpacker to extract "network
      pointers".&nbsp; Network pointers are simply memory addresses that reside
      on another machine.&nbsp; Although they're not useful to the server
      itself, when the client wants the server to sent it some information, it
      can put its local memory address in a packet, and the local memory
      address will get sent back along with the response.&nbsp; The networking
      layer will then take care of writing the payload data to the specified
      address.
    </p>
    <p>
      See <span class="File">spu/pack/packspu_net.c</span> for an example of a
      non-trivial receive function (unlike the server's, which always returns 0
      to let packets queue up) and usage of network pointers.

      The State Tracker
    </h2>
    <p>
      We saw the state tracker in action in the "<a href=
      "codegen.html">Automatically generating code for a SPU</a>"
      section.&nbsp; The state tracker is much too complex to describe every
      detail here.&nbsp; For a description of how it all works, read our
      <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/state_tracking" target=
      "_parent">Eurographics/SIGGRAPH Hardware Workshop 2000 paper</a>.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      The best way to figure out how state tracking works is to actually step
      through some of the code.&nbsp; Load an application in the debugger using
      the Chromium OpenGL DLL, as described in "<a href=
      "spudebug.html">Debugging a SPU</a>".&nbsp; Once the SPU's have been
      loaded, set breakpoints in various state calls that you think will
      happen, and see what they do.&nbsp; In particular, observing the behavior
      of <code class="Class">crStateDiff</code> in the <span class=
      "SPU">tilesort</span> SPU is very illuminating for the lazy state update
      process.
