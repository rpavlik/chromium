<p class="PageHeading">Known Bugs</p>
<p>Not everything works as advertised in Chromium, unfortunately.&nbsp;
Following is a list of issues I'm aware of at the time of this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SPU's cannot change their exported API on the fly.</li>
  <li>Display lists don't work with the Tilesort SPU.&nbsp; This is related to
    the previous bug.</li>
  <li>Flow control has some of the same issues that it did in WireGL.&nbsp; It's
    fairly easy for a small parallel submission program to overflow the memory
    of a server, particularly over TCP/IP.&nbsp; The &quot;psubmit&quot; program
    shows off this memory explosion nicely.&nbsp; This is partially due to the
    fact that the client doesn't exactly know how much memory a message will
    consume on the server, and partially due to the new networking abstraction
    (I think).&nbsp; This is a very high priority bug.</li>
  <li>DrawPixels/ReadPixels are not implemented.</li>
  <li>Evaluators aren't implemented in the Tilesort SPU.</li>
  <li>OpenGL Selection/Feedback buffers don't work.</li>
  <li>The Print SPU doesn't special-case many functions, so often a pointer
    address is printed when you're interested in the contents of the data.&nbsp;
    I've been updating the Print SPU as my debugging needs have dictated.</li>
  <li>Byte swapping isn't implemented, so a cluster has to be homogenous with
    respect to endianness.</li>
  <li>The networking abstraction still isn't as robust as I need to create
    network connections outside of the client/server model.</li>
  <li>The Render SPU will put up a new window even when it's bolted directly to
    an application, which is a little awkward.&nbsp; This is a high priority bug. </li>
  <li><code>glPushAttrib</code> and <code>glPopAttrib</code> are not
    implemented, although the framework to implement those calls exists. </li>
  <li>pixel data specified with <code>GL_LSB_FIRST</code> or <code>GL_SWAP_BYTES</code>
    cannot be unpacked. </li>
  <li>Certain <code>glGet</code> queried parameters do not reflect the actual
    state of the graphics card on the other end of a network (for example, the
    maximum texture size) </li>
  <li>The mothership does not start jobs for you; you have to start them
    manually </li>
  <li>Adding multiple tiles to a server is (very) partially implemented, and
    that part is untested.&nbsp; Consequently Lightning-2 is not supported. </li>
</ul>
