<h1 class="PageHeading">Your First Chromium Run</h1>
<p>Your first Chromium run will be something quite simple.&nbsp; One of the
programs built during the compile of the Chromium system is called &quot;<code>fonttest</code>&quot; -
you can go ahead and run it now.&nbsp; If everything is OK, you should see a
window appear with a text message in it.&nbsp; This window is using the system's
OpenGL - nothing Chromium-related has happened yet.&nbsp; To run this program
using Chromium, you will need to follow these three steps (you'll need three
shell windows open):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Components of any Chromium run will need to know what they are supposed to be
    doing.&nbsp; They get this information from the <i>configuration mothership</i>.&nbsp;
    The mothership is controlled by scripts written in the <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python</a>
    programming language.&nbsp; One such script is located in <code> cr/mothership/configs/crdemo.conf</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <b>NOTE</b>: You must edit this file to point at the directory containing
    binaries for Chromium.&nbsp; 
    I personally install things in a directory called
    &quot;C:\work&quot;, so if you installed things somewhere else, you need to
    edit the value of <code>CR_BIN_DIR</code> at the top of the file.&nbsp; No other changes to the file should be necessary.<br>
    <br>
    Now change to the <code> cr/mothership/configs</code> directory, and type:<br>
    <br>
    <code>python crdemo.conf fonttest</code><br>
    <br>
    The mothership will now be running, and you should see a message to that
    effect.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>In another window, start the Chromium server.&nbsp; From <i>any</i>
    directory, run<br>
    <br>
    <code>crserver</code><br>
    <br>
    That's all there is to it.&nbsp; The Chromium server will configure itself
    by asking questions to the mothership that you ran in step 1.&nbsp;
    The server will dispatch the incoming stream of commands to the first
    SPU hosted by the server (the Render SPU in this case).
    Note: previous versions of Chromium would open a window at this point.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>In a third window, start the Chromium &quot;application
    faker&quot;.&nbsp; This is a loader program that will start another
    unmodified application and make sure that it finds the Chromium
    OpenGL shared library instead of the system's.&nbsp; From <i>any</i>
    directory, run<br>
    <br>
    <code>crappfaker</code><br>
    <br>
    Again, the faker (and the OpenGL DLL, and the SPU's loaded by the OpenGL
    DLL) will all configure themselves by asking questions of the mothership
    started in step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once application starts you should see two windows appear: the Render SPU
window and the application window.
The application window belongs to the <code>fonttest</code>
program started by the application faker.&nbsp; As far as
<code>fonttest</code> knows, it is rendering to that window.&nbsp;
The Chromium OpenGL DLL intercepts all of <code>fonttest</code>'s calls to OpenGL and sends
them over the network (in this case, a TCP/IP connection to your local machine)
to the Chromium server, where they are dispatched to the system.</p> <p>The
Chromium run you have just done corresponds to the following graph of
nodes:</p>
