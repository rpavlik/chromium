<p class="PageHeading">Getting Help</p>
<p>Chromium ALPHA is essentially a technology preview.&nbsp; Many of the
features work, but some of them don't.&nbsp; See the &quot;<a href="bugs.html">List
of Known Bugs</a>&quot; page for a list of things that I know about today. </p>
<p>If you encounter something that you think isn't working right, and it's not
on the <a href="bugs.html">bug list</a>, you should file a bug report on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=116529&amp;group_id=16529&amp;func=browse" target="new_window">SourceForge
project bug tracking page</a>.&nbsp; You should browse the existing bugs first
to make sure you're not submitting a duplicate.</p>
<p>If you don't have a bug, but Chromium doesn't do something you think it ought
to, you can submit a feature request on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=366529&amp;group_id=16529&amp;func=browse" target="new_window">SourceForge
project feature request page</a>.&nbsp; Check out the &quot;<a href="todobeta.html">Things
To Do For Version BETA</a>&quot; page to see if it's already on that list.&nbsp;
Feature requests will (obviously) be lower priority than bugs, but they'll all
be taken seriously.&nbsp; Of course, if you have a feature request, you should
give thought to implementing it yourself if you have the resources.&nbsp; This
is an open-source project, after all.&nbsp; Well-done feature additions may be
rolled into the main source tree on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>If you need to contact me directly, just <a href="mailto:humper@graphics.stanford.edu">send
me mail at humper@graphics.stanford.edu</a>.&nbsp; Remember, I'm only one man,
so if I get swamped with e-mails, I'll just start ignoring them, so use this
wisely.</p>
<p>There are also three mailing lists, available from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=16529">SourceForge
project mailing list page</a>.&nbsp; <code>chromium-announce</code> is for
announcements relating to this project; it's very low-traffic, and everyone
should subscribe to this mailing list for critical update notification, BETA
release announcements, etc.&nbsp; <code>chromium-users</code> is for users of
the system who are not necessarily hacking on the code.&nbsp; Finally, <code>chromium-dev</code>
is a mailing list for people actively developing the system. </p>
