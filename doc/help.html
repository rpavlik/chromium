<p>Chromium ALPHA is essentially a technology preview.&nbsp; Many of the
features work, but some of them don't. </p>
<p>If you encounter something that you think isn't working right, you should file a bug report on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=116529&amp;group_id=16529&amp;func=browse" target="new_window">SourceForge
project bug tracking page</a>.&nbsp; Please browse the existing bugs first
to make sure you're not submitting a duplicate.</p>
<p>If you don't have a bug, but Chromium doesn't do something you think it
ought to, you can submit a feature request on the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=366529&amp;group_id=16529&amp;func=browse"
target="new_window">SourceForge project feature request page</a>.&nbsp; Feature requests
will (obviously) be lower priority than bugs, but they'll all be taken
seriously.&nbsp; Of course, if you have a feature request, you could give
thought to implementing it yourself if you have the resources.&nbsp; This is an
open-source project, after all.&nbsp; Feature additions may be rolled into the
main source tree on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>If you need to contact me directly, just <a href="mailto:humper@graphics.stanford.edu">send
me mail at humper@graphics.stanford.edu</a>.&nbsp; Remember, I'm only one man,
so please use this wisely.</p>
<p>There are also four mailing lists, available from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=16529" target="new_window">SourceForge
project mailing list page</a>.&nbsp; <code>chromium-announce</code> is for
announcements relating to this project.&nbsp; It's very low-traffic, and everyone
should subscribe to this mailing list for critical update notification, BETA
release announcements, etc.&nbsp; <code>chromium-users</code> is for users of
the system who are not necessarily hacking on the code.&nbsp; <code>chromium-dev</code>
is a mailing list for people actively developing the system.  Finally, <code>chromium-checkin</code> receives mail every time there is a change committed to the CVS repository, for those of you who want to stay on the very bleeding edge.</p>
