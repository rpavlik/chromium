      Chromium Introduction
    </h1>
    <p>
      Chromium is a system for interactive rendering on clusters of
      workstations.&nbsp; It is a completely extensible architecture, so that
      parallel rendering algorithms can be implemented on clusters with
      ease.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Among Chromium's features are
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sort-first (tiled) rendering - the frame buffer is subdivided into
      rectangular tiles which may be rendered in parallel by the hosts of a
      rendering cluster.
      </li>
      <li>Sort-last (Z-compositing) rendering - the 3D dataset is broken into N
      parts which are rendered in parallel by N processors. The resulting
      images are composited together according to their Z buffers to form the
      final image.
      </li>
      <li>Hybrid parallel rendering - sort-first and sort-last rendering may be
      combined into a hybrid configuration.
      </li>
      <li>OpenGL command stream filtering - OpenGL command streams may be
      intercepted and modified by a stream processing unit (SPU) to implement
      non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) effects, etc. Here's an <a href=
      "http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/archsplit/" target=
      "_parent">interesting example</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Many OpenGL programs can be used with Chromium without modification.
      </li>
      <li>One can write Chromium-specific applications which perform parallel
      rendering with the aid of special synchronization primitives.
      </li>
      <li>Chromium runs on Linux, IRIX, AIX, SunOS and Windows-based systems.
      </li>
      <li>Chromium is an open-source project.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Chromium is derived from the <a href=
      "http://graphics.stanford.edu/software/wiregl" target=
      "_parent">WireGL</a> project. Even if you're completely happy with your
      WireGL setup, we recommend replacing it with Chromium for several
      reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Numerous bugs have been found and fixed since the last WireGL
      release.
      </li>
      <li>The new configuration system will make setting up and reconfiguring
      your tiled display much simpler.
      </li>
      <li>Chromium has many, many more features.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This documentation serves as both a reference guide and tutorial for
      using and extending Chromium. See the the <a href="help.html">Where to

      Chromium is mainly the product of <a href=
      "http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~humper/" target="_parent">Greg
      Humphreys</a>.&nbsp; However, a few other individuals deserve special
      mention.&nbsp; <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~ianbuck/" target=
      "_parent">Ian Buck</a> wrote the original state tracking and bucketing
      system for WireGL, which the Chromium "tilesort" SPU and "state_tracker"
      library are loosely based on.&nbsp; Ian has also been in charge of the
      WireGL release process and maintenance for its 80+ users.&nbsp; <a href=
      "http://graphics.stanford.edu/~eldridge/" target="_parent">Matthew
      Eldridge</a> made significant improvements to WireGL's networking
      libraries and the overall system design, and his design philosophy (if
      not his code) lives on in Chromium.&nbsp; <a href=
      "http://www.ccntech.com/" target="_parent">Chris Niederauer</a> did most
      of the implementation of the OpenGL extensions, including all of the
      NVIDIA-specific ones.&nbsp; He also designed the Chromium logo and did a
      lot of really useful slave labor for us last summer when we were building
      our cluster.

      For the beta and 1.0 through 1.4 releases <a href=
      "mailto:brian.paul-no-spam@tungstengraphics.com" target="_parent">Brian
      Paul</a> and <a href="mailto:alanh@tungstengraphics.com" target=
      "_parent">Alan Hourihane</a> of Tungsten Graphics, Inc. contributed much
      of the development. Brian and <a href="mailto:alanm@redhat.com" target=
      "_parent">Alan Matsuoka (of Red Hat)</a> made many contributions to the
      Chromium 1.4 through 1.7 releases.
