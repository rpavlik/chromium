<h1 class="PageHeading">Chromium Introduction</h1>
<p>Chromium is a new system for interactive rendering on clusters of
workstations.&nbsp; It is a completely extensible architecture, so that parallel
rendering algorithms can be implemented on clusters with ease.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Among Chromium's features are</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sort-first (tiled) rendering - the frame buffer is subdivided
      into rectangular tiles which may be rendered in parallel by the
      hosts of a rendering cluster.</li>
  <li>Sort-last (Z-compositing) rendering - the 3D dataset is broken
      into N parts which are rendered in parallel by N processors.
      The resulting images are composited together according to their
      Z buffers to form the final image.</li>
  <li>Hybrid parallel rendering - sort-first and sort-last rendering
      may be combined into a hybrid configuration.</li>
  <li>OpenGL command stream filtering - OpenGL command streams may
      be intercepted and modified by a stream processing unit (SPU)
      to implement non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) effects, etc.</li>
  <li>Many OpenGL programs can be used with Chromium without
      modification.</li>
  <li>One can write Chromium-specific applications which perform parallel
      rendering with the aid of special synchronization primitives.</li>
  <li>Chromium runs on Linux, IRIX, AIX, SunOS and Windows-based systems.</li>
  <li>Chromium is an open-source project.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chromium is derived from the
<a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/software/wiregl">WireGL</a> project.
Even if you're completely happy with your WireGL setup, we recommend
replacing it with Chromium for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Numerous bugs have been found and fixed since the last WireGL release.</li>
  <li>The new configuration system will make setting up and reconfiguring your
    tiled display much simpler.</li>
  <li>Chromium has many, many more features.</li>
</ul>

<p>This documentation serves as both a reference guide and tutorial for
using and extending Chromium.  See the the <a href="help.html">Where to
get help</a> link for other resources.
</p>

<p>Chromium is mainly the product of one graduate student, <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~humper">Greg
Humphreys</a>.&nbsp; However, a few other individuals deserve special
mention.&nbsp; <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~ianbuck/">Ian Buck</a>
wrote the original state tracking and bucketing system for WireGL, which the
Chromium &quot;tilesort&quot; SPU and &quot;state_tracker&quot; library are
loosely based on.&nbsp; Ian has also been in charge of the WireGL release
process and maintenance for its 80+ users.&nbsp; <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~eldridge/">Matthew
Eldridge</a> made significant improvements to WireGL's networking libraries and
the overall system design, and his design philosophy (if not his code) lives on
in Chromium.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ccntech.com/">Chris Niederauer</a> did
most of the implementation of the OpenGL extensions, including all of the
NVIDIA-specific ones.&nbsp; He also designed the Chromium logo and did a lot of
really useful slave labor for us last summer when we were building our
cluster. </p>

<p>For the beta release, <a href="http://www.mesa3d.org/brianp/home.html">
Brian Paul</a> (Tungsten Graphics) and <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/~alanh">
Alan Hourihane</a> (Red Hat)
contributed many new features.</p>


<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Version History</h2>

<p>Alpha Release:  July 2001</p>

<ul>
<li>This was the initial public release of Chromium.
</ul>


<p>Beta Release:  April 5, 2002</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multi-context/window support
      This allows OpenGL applications to create more than one 3D window
      or GL rendering context to work with Chromium.  See the
      'minimum_window_size' and 'match_window_title' config options.
      Some windows can be rendered by Chromium, others by the native OpenGL.

  <li>Improved OpenGL conformance.
      The OpenGL conformance and coverage tests identified a lot of
      problems, many of which have been fixed.
      See the doc/conformance.html file.

  <li>Support for more than 32 clients and rendering contexts.
      The limit may be specified in include/cr_glwrapper.h

  <li>glRead/DrawPixels support

  <li>New Chromium extensions to OpenGL (see include/cr_glwrapper.h)
      Among these is an extension that allows client programs to get
      the tilesort configuration parameters.

  <li>Tilesort SPU validation test program.  See cr/progs/tiletest/

  <li>Specification of visual attributes to crCreateContext().

  <li>addes stub functions for OpenGL 1.2 entrypoints and some extensions
    to fix link problems.

  <li>Improved GL error handling - don't just abort when we detect
      user's GL errors.

  <li>Evaluators support 

  <li>GL_EXT_texture_object support (for Performer)

  <li>crCreateContext() now takes a bitmask of desired visual properties
      and returns a context value which is passed to crMakeCurrent.  See
      the psubmit.d program for details.

  <li>Linux Alpha AXP support

  <li>Numerous bug fixes from application testing

  <li>Fully functional readback SPU with support for Z-compositing and tile
      reassembly.

  <li>Thread safety.  Programs can issue Chromium rendering commands
      from several threads in parallel.

  <li>Updated documentation
</ul>


<p><EM>Upcoming</EM> 1.0 Release:  (month) (day), 2002</p>

<ul>
  <li>Graphical configuration tools
  <li>Fixed GM memory leak (Michael Brodeur)
  <li>Cygwin 5.1 patches (Sebastien Barre)
  <li>New server/network node parameter: only_swap_once
  <li>New render SPU options: render_to_app_window, resizable
  <li>New performance SPU (perf) for collecting performance statistics
  <li>New feedback & selection SPU (feedback)
  <li>SunOS support (Jorge Luis Williams)
</ul>
