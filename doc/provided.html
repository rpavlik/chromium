<p align="center"><font size="7">What Comes With Chromium ALPHA?</font></p>
<p align="left">Chromium can (thankfully) do more than just the <a href="helloworld.html">Hello,
World</a> demo, even in this ALPHA release.&nbsp; In particular, it comes with a
couple of other SPU's that let it behave like <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/software/wiregl">WireGL</a>
with a few new features to boot.&nbsp; Note that since this is an ALPHA release,
statements like &quot;the full OpenGL API&quot; or &quot;the full OpenGL
graphics state&quot; should be taken with a grain of salt; some things haven't
been implemented, and some things probably don't work right.</p>
<p align="center"><font size="5">What you've seen so far</font></p>
<p>If you've been reading the documentation in order, you've already seen a few
crucial Chromium components, and those are (obviously) provided with the ALPHA
release:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>The configuration mothership<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </i> The mothership handles all configuration requests for all
    components of the system.</li>
  <li><i>Several example configuration scripts<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The provided example scripts are the ones that I use
    from day-to-day.&nbsp; Many of them are quite similar and just point at
    different demo directories, although some are set up specifically to drive
    Stanford's display wall</li>
  <li><i>A &quot;render&quot; SPU <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </i> This SPU hands all OpenGL calls to the system's OpenGL
    implementation.</li>
  <li><i>A &quot;pack&quot; SPU that generates a network stream<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>This SPU generates a streaming encoding of its OpenGL
    calls.&nbsp; Although the calls are encoded verbatim (i.e., with no
    analysis), some state tracking is still necessary in order to properly
    unpack pixel data for texture maps.</li>
  <li><i>An OpenGL replacement library<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>This library &quot;fakes&quot; unmodified
    applications into rendering to a SPU.&nbsp; Although SPU's implement the
    OpenGL interface, they only actually export a very small number of
    symbols.&nbsp; The SPU loader will create a collection of function pointers
    for the SPU's functions.&nbsp; The replacement library is necessary to
    actually resemble the system's OpenGL interface sufficiently to broker
    requests from applications to SPU's.&nbsp; Note that an application could
    easily load a SPU from disk itself and use it without the OpenGL library,
    which would be one possible way to render to a local screen and over a
    network simultaneously.</li>
  <li><i>An application launcher<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </i> The launcher, called &quot;<code>crappfaker</code>&quot;,
    launches applications in a special way that causes them to load the OpenGL
    replacement library rather than the system's library.</li>
  <li><i>A network server</i> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This server, called &quot;<code>crserver</code>&quot;, is
    responsible for dispatching incoming blocks of encoded OpenGL commands to a
    chain of SPU's.&nbsp; In fact, as we will see, the network server is really
    a stream &quot;serializer&quot;.&nbsp; It is the job of the server to accept
    streams from <i>multiple</i> clients, and context switch between them as
    allowed by the <a href="parallelapplication.html">parallel API extensions</a>.&nbsp;
    In addition, a server can manage multiple tiles, and is responsible for
    re-decoding a block of work multiple times, with appropriate modifications
    to the viewing matrices for multiple tiles.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><font size="5">Other SPU's</font></p>
<p>In addition to the SPU's shown so far, several more are provided.&nbsp; Some
of the SPU's are intended to be used directly in a graph, and others are more
useful as starting points for new SPU's, or SPU's to <a href="newspu.html">inherit
from</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>The &quot;error&quot; SPU<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </i> This SPU will issue a fatal error on any OpenGL
    call.&nbsp; The error message will contain the name of the function
    called.&nbsp; This SPU is useful for handling &quot;impossible&quot;
    function calls.&nbsp; If the reader is already familiar with <a href="newspu.html">SPU
    inheritance</a>, all SPU's are implicitly a subSPU of the &quot;error&quot;
    SPU.</li>
  <li><i>The &quot;nop&quot; SPU<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </i> This SPU will silently discard all OpenGL calls.&nbsp;
    This SPU is most useful for understanding the performance of applications
    and cluster configurations.&nbsp; By replacing the &quot;render&quot; SPU
    with the &quot;nop&quot; SPU, time spent actually executing OpenGL commands
    can be eliminated.&nbsp; Similarly, the &quot;nop&quot; SPU can be used on
    the client to make all OpenGL calls &quot;free&quot;.&nbsp; This helps
    establish a baseline for performance.</li>
  <li><i>The &quot;passthrough&quot; SPU<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </i> This SPU will pass all calls to the next SPU in a
    chain.&nbsp; Note that it can therefore never appear as the last SPU in a
    chain (this is a checked, fatal error).&nbsp; This SPU is not useful by
    itself, but it is a very useful SPU to inherit from in order to implement a
    subset of the OpenGL API.&nbsp; An example of such a SPU is shown in the
    &quot;<a href="newspu">Writing a new SPU</a>&quot; section.</li>
  <li><i>The &quot;print&quot; SPU<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </i> This SPU was alluded to in the &quot;<a href="configscripts.html">Configuration
    scripts</a>&quot; section.&nbsp; It produces a human-readable dump of all
    OpenGL calls, either to standard output (default), or to a file.&nbsp; This
    is an invaluable tool for debugging, although it does have a fairly serious
    impact on performance.&nbsp; Some attempt is also made to turn <code>GLenum</code>
    types back into human-readable strings (thanks to <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~kekoa">Kekoa
    Proudfoot</a> for this code).</li>
  <li><i>The &quot;template&quot; SPU<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>This SPU actually implements no functions (it is
    therefore exactly equivalent to the &quot;error&quot; SPU, due to the
    implicit inheritance).&nbsp; However, a script is provided to rename all
    files and update the source code to create a new SPU of a given name.&nbsp;
    Therefore, when creating a new SPU, a copy should be made of the <code>cr/spu/template</code>
    directory, and this script should be run.&nbsp; This is the approach used in
    the &quot;<a href="newspu.html">Writing a new SPU</a>&quot; section.</li>
  <li><i>The &quot;tilesort&quot; SPU<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>This SPU uses the techniques described in our <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/clust_render/" target="_blank">SuperComputing
    2000 paper</a> to drive a tiled display efficiently from a single serial
    stream of OpenGL commands.&nbsp; One-third of the logic of WireGL can be
    found in this library (the other thirds being in the server, and the state
    tracker, listed below).</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><font size="5">Useful libraries</font></p>
<p>Chromium also builds several shared libraries which can be used by any
component.</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>An &quot;application stub&quot; library for Chromium-aware applications<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>This library can be used by Chromium-aware
    applications that wish, for instance, to use the Parallel API.&nbsp; It also
    provides routines for creating an OpenGL context without ever opening a
    window, a useful thing for a distributed application to do (since it doesn't
    necessarily make sense for dozens of blank faked-out client windows to
    spring up all over the cluster, especially when all of your cluster nodes
    aren't running X-Windows).&nbsp; This approach is preferred over defining
    the Chromium-specific functions as OpenGL extensions and using something
    like <code>wglGetProcAddress</code> to extract the function pointers, since
    the application stub library is portable and applications don't need to
    concern themselves with the type of system they are running on.</li>
  <li><i>A client library for the configuration mothership<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </i> Applications that need to talk to the configuration
    mothership will use this library to make queries.&nbsp; It hides the fact
    that the mothership is possibly on a remote machine through an opaque &quot;<code>CRConnection</code>&quot;
    data structure.&nbsp; New SPU's or other system components can access any
    piece of configuration through this library.</li>
  <li><i>A library for packing WireGL-format network buffers<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </i> This library provides a &quot;packing&quot; function for
    each OpenGL function.&nbsp; When such a function is called, the function
    arguments and an opcode are packed into a buffer for eventual
    transmission.&nbsp; Although this library exports a full OpenGL interface,
    it is not really a SPU.&nbsp; In particular, the packing functions for
    OpenGL calls requiring pixel data (e.g., <code>glTexImage2D</code>) require
    additional arguments detailing the unpacking state.&nbsp; For an example of
    this usage, see <code>cr/spu/pack/pack_pixel.c</code>.&nbsp; Currently, this
    library is used by both the &quot;pack&quot; and &quot;tilesort&quot; SPU's.</li>
  <li><i>A library for loading SPUs from disk<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>This library loads a SPU from a named file and
    creates its dispatch table.&nbsp; Although this library is mostly designed
    to be used internally by the OpenGL stub library and the server,
    applications can load SPU's explicitly if they wish.</li>
  <li><i>A library for tracking OpenGL state<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>This library provides the necessary functionality to
    track the complete OpenGL graphics state.&nbsp; This library is quite
    complex, both because the OpenGL state is large and intricate, and also
    because it contains the logic for doing differencing between contexts.&nbsp;
    Graphics contexts are represented with &quot;hierarchical dirty bits&quot;
    so that they can be compared extremely efficiently, a frequent operation
    when updating a tiled display or switching between contexts on the
    server.&nbsp; This library does most of the OpenGL error checking, and
    satisfies <code>glGet*</code> requests locally.&nbsp; For a description of
    the techniques used by this library, see our <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/state_tracking" target="_blank">2000
    Eurographics/SIGGRAPH Workshop on Graphics Hardware paper</a>.&nbsp; This
    library is used heavily by both the &quot;tilesort&quot; SPU and the server,
    but the &quot;pack&quot; SPU uses it sparingly to keep track of the pixel
    unpack state for textures.</li>
  <li><i>A library for unpacking WireGL-format network buffers<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </i> The dual of the packing library mentioned above, this
    library decodes network-encoded OpenGL streams and dispatches them to an
    arbitrary SPU interface.&nbsp; Currently this is only used by the server,
    although a special SPU could use the pack library <i>and</i> the unpack
    library together to make multiple passes over a stream.</li>
  <li><i>A &quot;utility&quot; library<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </i> This library contains a number of useful routines and data
    structures that are used by many components of the system.&nbsp; A (possibly
    non-exhaustive) list of features exported by this library is:
    <ul>
    	<li>Buffer pool management -- efficient &quot;allocate&quot; and
          &quot;free&quot; of fixed-size buffers</li>
    	<li>A DLL abstraction for portably opening shared libraries explicitly
          and extracting symbols</li>
    	<li>A portable abstraction for interacting with environment variables</li>
    	<li>A set of error reporting/warning/debug routines, and an assertion
          macro</li>
    	<li>Hashtables</li>
    	<li>A portable heap-based memory allocator that (severely) handles
          memory allocation errors.</li>
    	<li>Routines for packing/unpacking pixel data</li>
    	<li>Routines for robustly handling strings, including splitting strings
          on a substring (useful in parsing mothership responses)</li>
    	<li>Routines for cracking apart URL's, since server's are specified
          using a pseudo-URL type syntax</li>
    	<li>A connection-based networking abstraction supporting multiple
          transport layers, credit-based flow control, and message fragmentation</li>
    	<li>A &quot;devnull&quot; implementation of the networking abstraction
          that drops packets on the floor.&nbsp; Useful for measuring the
          performance of the &quot;pack&quot; or &quot;tilesort&quot; SPU's
          without involving the actual physical transport medium.</li>
    	<li>A TCP/IP implementation of the networking abstraction</li>
    	<li>A Myrinet GM implementation of the networking abstraction</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><font size="5">Other programs</font></p>
<p>A few small programs are built as part off the Chromium build process.&nbsp;
They won't all be listed here, as many of them are small test or demo programs.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>resetms<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </code> This program resets the mothership to its initial
    state.&nbsp; Because multiple applications or servers could run on one
    computer (called, say, &quot;sluff&quot;), the mothership remembers when it
    has been contacted by a server running on &quot;sluff&quot;, so the next
    time a server running on &quot;sluff&quot; identifies itself, the mothership
    knows which one it is.&nbsp; This means that after a Chromium run, the
    mothership is in an unusable state, since it will no longer accept server
    connections from &quot;sluff&quot;.&nbsp; Running resetms will destroy all
    of the mothership's internal state.&nbsp; This is generally preferable to
    quitting the mothership and starting it again, especially since the socket
    isn't always properly released, which will prevent the mothership from
    starting up on its default port for a minute or two.</li>
  <li><code>sputest</code><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is a simple demonstration that an
    application can load a mSPU and use it without the help of &quot;<code>crappfaker</code>&quot;
    or the OpenGL stub library.&nbsp; It draws a single triangle rotating around
    the center of the screen.</li>
  <li>psubmit<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is just about the simplest example of a parallel
    OpenGL program.&nbsp; Instance &quot;1&quot; of this program will draw a
    blue triangle, and instance &quot;2&quot; of this program will draw a green
    triangle.&nbsp; With the right config script (see <code>cr/mothership/configs/psubmit.conf</code>
    for an example), this program can be used to verify that the server's
    parallel API synchronization primitives are working and that parallel
    submission is, in theory, possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the other programs that are built are designed to exercise one
particular portion of the system.&nbsp; Some of them are contributed bugs from
WireGL (thanks in particular to Peter Kirchner for providing some VERY stripped
down programs that trip a bug), and there are a number of programs that each
demonstrate the functionality of a single OpenGL extensions (all found in the <code>cr/progs/extensions/*</code>
directories).</p>
<p align="center"><font size="5">Miscellany</font></p>
<p>The Chromium ALPHA distribution contains some other useful stuff that isn't a
SPU, library, or program:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>A pretty slick build system<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Chromium's build system is mainly designed to achieve
    two goals.&nbsp; First, creating a new Makefile for a library or program
    should be as simple as possible.&nbsp; Second, it should be possible to
    build the code on multiple operating systems from the same network-mounted
    drive without any object files or dependencies conflicting with each
    other.&nbsp; Users who want to port Chromium to a new system will need to
    create a new make-system-configuration file in <code>cr/config</code>, most
    likely just using one of the existing files as a template.&nbsp; The build
    will also quit with an error on various system-dependent things in the
    &quot;utility&quot; library, such as the abstraction for DLL's, etc.&nbsp;
    The build system also includes a very fast perl-based C/C++ dependency
    generator due to <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~eldridge">Matthew
    Eldridge</a> in <code>cr/scripts/fastdep.pl</code>.</li>
  <li><i>This documentation</i> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A copy of this documentation can be found in <code>cr/doc</code>,
    if that's not where you're reading it from already.</li>
  <li><i>A parsed representation of the OpenGL API<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </i> The scripts in <code>cr/glapi_parser </code>parse a
    massaged version of the Windows OpenGL header, and also a Chromium-specific
    header containing our supported extension functions (e.g., <code>glBlendColorEXT</code>,
    <code>glBarrierExec</code>, etc).&nbsp; This parsed representation is used
    by almost every component of the system to automatically generate some or
    all of their code.</li>
  <li><i>Useful routines for manipulating the parsed representation of the
    OpenGL API<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </i> The routines available in <code>cr/opengl_stub/stub_common.py</code>
    are available for use by any Python script that is generating Chromium
    code.&nbsp; It is used quite heavily throughout most of the system.&nbsp; In
    particular, it provides a very easy way to tag certain OpenGL functions as
    &quot;special&quot;.&nbsp; For example, many of the OpenGL packing functions
    can be auto-generated, but some (like <code>glMaterialfv</code>) are more
    complicated and need to be coded by hand.&nbsp; The complex functions can
    simply be listed in a separate file, and the contents of that file
    efficiently examined through the API exposed by these Python routines.</li>
</ul>
