<h1 class="PageHeading">Debugging a SPU</h1>
<p>Because SPU's are usually loaded by our OpenGL implementation, it's not
always that easy to debug them.&nbsp; You can't just run a debugger on your
application, since it won't pick up our library.&nbsp; This page describes some
techniques you can use to debug a SPU.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Technique 1: Write a Windows batch file</h2>
<p>This is by far the simplest thing you can do (if you're running Windows), and
it's the way I debug all the time.&nbsp; I use a batch file called <code>crdebug.bat</code>,
which contains the following commands:</p>
<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">cp %1.exe c:/work/cr/scratch<br>
      cp c:/work/cr/bin/WIN_NT/crfaker.dll c:/work/cr/scratch/opengl32.dll<br>
      "C:\VS60\Common\MSDev98\Bin\MSDEV.EXE" c:\work\cr\scratch\%1.exe</td></tr></table>
<p>Using this batch file (which I put in <code>cr/bin/WIN_NT</code>), I go to
the directory containing the executable, and type:</p>
<p><code>crdebug &lt;executable_name&gt;</code></p>
<p>That's it.&nbsp; Obviously you will want to modify the paths used to reflect
your system's setup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This uses a &quot;scratch&quot; directory that I made in <code>c:\work\cr\scratch</code>.&nbsp;
It basically copies the faker DLL to the scratch directory, along with the
executable, and runs the debugger on the executable.&nbsp; Windows will search
the directory that contains the executable first, so this technique works (it's
a lot like how the application faker works).</p>
<p>This technique has a drawback, however.&nbsp; Since SPU's are loaded
explicitly when an OpenGL context is created, you cannot set a breakpoint inside
a SPU when the program is loaded.&nbsp; You have to single-step through the
program until the context is created, and then you may set breakpoints.&nbsp;
Every time you restart the Microsoft debugger, your breakpoints will all be
temporarily disabled.&nbsp; You can re-enable them all at once by using the
&quot;<code>Edit-&gt;Breakpoints</code>&quot; menu item.&nbsp; This is tedious,
but it's the path of least resistance.</p>
<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Technique 2: Create a &quot;debug&quot; directory</h2>
<p>To debug SPU's on Linux, I have a directory called <code>cr/ldebug</code>,
which I populate with symlinks to the OpenGL faker library.&nbsp; Here is a
listing of the contents of that directory:</p>
<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">chromite(cr)% ls -l ldebug<br>
      total 0<br>
      lrwxrwxrwx    1 humper   graphics       41 Jul  3 10:24 libGL.so ->
      /u/humper/work/cr/lib/Linux/libcrfaker.so*<br>
      lrwxrwxrwx    1 humper   graphics        8 Jul  3 10:25 libGL.so.1 ->
      libGL.so*<br>
      lrwxrwxrwx    1 humper   graphics        8 Jul  3 10:25 libGL.so.1.0.1251 -> libGL.so*</td></tr></table>
<p>If you have &quot;<code>.</code>&quot; (the current directory) on your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>,
you can just change to this directory before invoking the debugger.&nbsp; One
disadvantage to this technique as opposed to technique 1 is that you won't have
control over the application's working directory.&nbsp; If you need data files
(textures, usually), I generally would make a symlink to those too.</p>
<p>This technique has the same drawback of having to step through the code until
a context is created, but it does work well.</p>
<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Technique 3: Use a programmatic breakpoint</h2>
<p>In Windows, you can add the statement:</p>
<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">DebugBreak();</td></tr></table>
<p>anywhere in your code, and when that statement is executed, you will be
prompted to load the debugger at that point.&nbsp; The debugger will come up
pointing at some assembly code, and by stepping forward (with the F10 key)
twice, you'll be back at the place where <code>DebugBreak</code> appears.&nbsp;
The program is still running!</p>
<p>This is often a useful technique for setting conditional breakpoints deep
within a library, since you don't have to worry about waiting for the context to
be created, etc.&nbsp; Also, this is by far the best way to enter the debugger
in your <code>SPUInit</code> function.</p>
<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Technique 4: Attach a debugger to a running process</h2>
<p>Many systems will allow you to attach a debugger to a running process without
interrupting it.&nbsp; In Windows, you can do this simply by right clicking on
the process name in the Task Manager, in Linux there's some option at the GDB
prompt (can you tell where I do all my development?).&nbsp; This way, if you
want to emulate the <code>DebugBreak</code> functionality without using it
explicitly, you can do something like:</p>
<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">volatile int i = 10; // so
      the compiler doesn't warn or optimize it away<br>
      while (i == 10)<br>
      {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // EMPTY BODY<br>
      }</td></tr></table>
<p>Once your program starts to loop forever, attach the debugger, force the
value of <code>i</code> to be something else, and you've got your homemade
breakpoint.&nbsp; This is pretty tedious, but handy sometimes when <code>DebugBreak</code>
isn't available.&nbsp; It might be useful to have your program print out its PID,
since you will probably need that to attach to the process (on UNIX, anyway).</p>
<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Technique 5: Use the Print SPU liberally</h2>
<p>The Print SPU has made debugging of other SPU's much easier.&nbsp; By placing
it between the client and its SPU, and also in front of the Render SPU on a
server, I can see exactly what transformations are being made to the stream by
comparing the two printouts.</p>
