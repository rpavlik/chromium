<h1 class="PageHeading">Benchmarking</h1>

<p>
This section describes how to measure the performance of Chromium's
network layer, command packer/unpacker and rendering.
</p>

<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Network Performance</h2>

<p>
Network performance can be measured with the <em>npclient</em> and
<em>npserver</em> programs.
Here's a simple example:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open two terminal windows.
    Make sure your command path includes the Chromium binary directory
    and that your library search path includes the Chromium
    library directory.
    If you've run the <a href="helloworld.html">Hello, World demo</a>,
    you should be all set.
    </p>
<li><p>In the first window, start the npserver:</p>
<pre>
    npserver
</pre>
<li><p>In the second window, start the npclient:</p>
<pre>
    npclient -a localhost
</pre>
<li><p>You should see output similar to this:</p>
<pre>
    npclient:  MTU=10000  (automatic buffer sizing)
    npclient:  Connecting to servers
    npclient:  Connection to localhost OK.
    npclient:  Testing...
    npclient:   221.076 MB/s (10000 bytes / buffer, 110538 buffers, 1 servers)
    npclient:   438.653 MB/s (100000 bytes / buffer, 21933 buffers, 1 servers)
    npclient:   228.321 MB/s (1000000 bytes / buffer, 1142 buffers, 1 servers)
    npclient:   222.620 MB/s (10000000 bytes / buffer, 112 buffers, 1 servers)
    npclient:   206.497 MB/s (100000000 bytes / buffer, 11 buffers, 1 servers)
    npclient:  done!
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
The npclient and npserver programs mimic Chromium's client/application and
server/network nodes but are stripped down to just test networking functions.
</p>
<p>
The npserver program simply receives messages sent to it by the npclient
program.
</p>
<p>
The npclient program takes a variety of command line options to specify
the number and size of buffers to send to the servers.
You can test one-to-many network communication by starting several npserver
instances and specifying the host names to npclient.
</p>
<p>
For example, here's how one might test network performance to two rendering
nodes in a cluster:
</p>

<ul>
<li>On the host <em>cr1</em>, start a npserver:
<pre>
    rsh cr1 npserver
</pre>
<li>On the host <em>cr2</em>, start another npserver:
<pre>
    rsh cr2 npserver
</pre>
<li>On the application host, run npclient.  This will send 500
    100000-byte buffers to both cr1 and cr2:
<pre>
    npclient -b 100000 -n 500 cr1 cr2
</pre>
<li>Here's the results running on a switched 100Mbit Ethernet network:
<pre>
    npclient:  Connection to cr2 OK.
    npclient:  Testing...
    npclient:     5.898 MB/s (100000 bytes / buffer, 500 buffers, 2 servers)
    npclient:  done!
</pre>
<li>Note that 5.898 MB/s * 2 servers * 8 bits/byte = 94.3 Mbits/second which
    is close to the limit for 100Mbit Ethernet.
</ul>

<p>
Both npclient and npserver take a few simple command line options.
To see them, specify the -h option to either program.
</p>



<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Packing/unpacking Performance</h2>

<p>
The packperf program measures the rate at which glVertex commands
can be processed by the packer.
</p>
<p>
XXX additional measurements with packertest framework???
</p>



<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Rendering Performance</h2>

<p>
The <em>spheres</em> program is a handy program for measuring triangle
throughput in Chromium.
It can be used in sort-first, sort-last, or other configurations.
</p>

<p>
Basically, spheres draws a user-specified number of spheres (arranged
in a circle), each with a user-specified number of triangles.
The spheres may be rendered as immediate-mode vertex arrays, display
lists or as vertex arrays in vertex buffer objects
(with GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object).
</p>

<p>
Here's an example of running the spheres demo in a sort-last configuration:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Start the mothership:
<pre>
    cd mothership/configs
    python psubmit_last.conf spheres
</pre>
<li>In another shell, start the first application instance:
<pre>
    crappfaker
</pre>
<li>In another shell, start the second application instance:
<pre>
    crappfaker
</pre>
<li>In another shell, start the crserver:
<pre>
    crserver
</pre>
<li><p>You should see threee windows.
    One application window will show red spheres, the second application
    window will show green spheres, and the third window will show the
    red and green spheres Z-composited together.</p>
<li><p>Each application instance will print the number of triangles rendered
    per second, as well as the number of pixels being composited per second.
    You should see something similar to this:</p>
<pre>
    spheres:  13456 triangles / sphere
    spheres:  13686 indices / sphere
    spheres:  12 spheres / ring
    spheres:  161472 triangles / ring
    spheres:  126582 bytes / VBO
    spheres:  Drawing Mode: Conventional glDrawRangeElements
    spheres:  6.5 fps   1.051e+06 tris/sec   1.042e+06 pixels/sec
    spheres:  6.8 fps   1.092e+06 tris/sec   1.082e+06 pixels/sec
    spheres:  6.7 fps   1.076e+06 tris/sec   1.066e+06 pixels/sec
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Here's an example of running spheres in a tilesort configuration:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Start the mothership
<pre>
    python simplemural.conf spheres
</pre>
<li>In another shell, start the first crserver:
<pre>
    crserver
</pre>
<li>In another shell, start the second crserver:
<pre>
    crserver
</pre>
<li>In another shell, start the application:
<pre>
    crappfaker
</pre>
<li>Again, the triangle rate will be printed to stdout.
</ul>


<p>
The spheres program accept several command-line parameters:
</p>
<pre>
   -size N     specifies number of parallel instances
   -rank I     specifies instance's rank in [0..N-1]
   -swap       do SwapBuffers
   -clear      do glClear
   -s N        specifies number of spheres per frame
   -t N        specifies approximate number of triangles per sphere
   -f N        specifies number of frames to render before exiting
   -v          render with vertex buffer objects
   -d          render with display lists
   -h          print help
</pre>
