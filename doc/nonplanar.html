<h1 class="PageHeading">Non-planar Tilesort Rendering</h1>

<p>
Typically, a tilesort configuration renders a physically (and logically)
flat mural.  That is, all the image tiles lie in the same plane.
Chromium 1.6 and later supports non-planar tilesorting for applications
such as virtual reality displays (such as the CAVE).
</p>

<p>
This discussion will focus on CAVE-like configurations in which there
are two or more walls arranged around the user at right angles.
Chromium is not limited to this arrangement, however;
image tiles may be arbitrarily oriented.
</p>

<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Running a CAVE with Chromium</h2>

<p>
A CAVE system typically has two or three walls and a floor upon which
video projectors display views of the virtual world.
Usually, applications need to be modified to use the CAVE library before
they can be run in a CAVE.
Furthermore, a separate instance of the application may need to be running
on each of the rendering hosts (they must be synchronized as well).
With Chromium's non-planar tilesort feature, unmodified applications can
be run in a CAVE (with some limitations).
</p>

<p>
Our approach is to use a Chromium server/render node to drive each video
wall and run one instance of the application with a tilesort SPU.

The Chromium configuration file specifies the size and orientation of each
wall, the view frustums, etc.
</p>

<p>
Two levels of functionality (and complexity) are available:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Run unmodified applications, but with no CAVE head tracking.
<li>Modify the application to support CAVE head tracking.
</ol>

<p>
To summarize how things work:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The tilesort SPU can record a sequence of OpenGL rendering commands and
replay them for an aribitrary number of servers.
<li>For each server we can manipulate the OpenGL modelview and projection
matrices to render different views of the scene.
<li>If the application performs view-specific culling then Chromium may
not display all the appropriate geometry.
</ul>




<h2 class="PageSubHeading">First Example (cavetest1.conf)</h2>

<p>
The mothership/configs/cavetest1.conf file is a simple example of driving
a CAVE-like system with Chromium.
As is, all of the CAVE walls/views are displayed in windows on the local
host.
But this configuration file can be easily modified to support a real CAVE.
</p>

<p>
Here are the interesting bits of the cavetest1.conf file.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Specify some configuration parameters, including number of walls and their
size (in pixels).
    <pre>
    WALLS = 4
    WALL_WIDTH = 300
    WALL_HEIGHT = 300
    </pre>
<p>
A real CAVE configuration would, of course, use larger wall sizes such
as 1024 x 1024.
</p>
</li>

<li>
This code creates a tilesort SPU and configures the bucketing mode to use
<em>Frustum</em> testing.
Frustum bucketing tests the 3D bounding box of OpenGL primitives against
the viewing frustum to determine which tiles (walls) will receive the
geometry.
<pre>
    tilesortspu = SPU( 'tilesort' )
    tilesortspu.Conf('bucket_mode', 'Frustum')
</pre>
</li>

<li>
Next, for each the CAVE walls (counted with the <code>wall</code> variable)
we do the following:
</li>
<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Create a render SPU for the wall and set its window geometry.
        For a real CAVE configuration one would instead set the fullscreen
        option.
    <pre>
    renderspu = SPU( 'render' )
    renderspu.Conf( 'window_geometry', [wall*(WALL_WIDTH+10), 0, WALL_WIDTH, WALL_HEIGHT] )
    </pre>
    </li>

    <li>Create a network/server node for the wall, disable optimized bucketing,
        and add the tile.
    <pre>
    node = CRNetworkNode( )
    node.Conf('optimize_bucket', 0)
    node.AddTile( 0, 0, WALL_WIDTH, WALL_HEIGHT )
    </pre>
        <p>
        A real CAVE configuration would specify a unique host for each
        network node.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>Specify a viewing matrix for the node corresponding to the wall.
        In our example, we can
        simply rotate the view direction about the Y axis for each wall.
        In a more sophisticated configuration we might also specify a
        floor view with another rotation.
    <pre>
    v = CRMatrix()
    v.YRotate(90 * wall)
    v.Translate(0, 0, zTranslate)  # undo application view translation
    node.Conf('view_matrix', v.ToList())
    </pre>
        <p>
        The crmatrix.py module offers a set of matrix functions which mimics
        OpenGL's matrix functions.
        These can be used to compose an arbitrary viewing transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
        The viewing matrix we specify here will premultiply the application's
        normal modelview matrix.
        The net effect is the whole scene is rotated by the view matrix
        specified here.
        </p>
        <p>
	Since most applications first put a Z-axis translation on the
        modelview matrix to position the camera, one will typically undo
        that translation by multiplying the viewing matrix by an opposite
        translation.  This is seen above.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the case of the city demo,
        this positions us right in the middle of the city, instead of
        outside of it.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>Next, we override the application's projection matrix with our own.
        In the case of a cubical CAVE with the observer assumed to be at
        the center, we want to use a 90-degree symmetric viewing frustum
        for all walls.
    <pre>
    p = CRMatrix()
    p.Frustum( -fScale, fScale, -fScale, fScale, fScale, farPlane )
    node.Conf('projection_matrix', p.ToList())
    </pre>
        <p>
        Again, we use the crmatrix.py module to produce a
        perspective projection with the OpenGL-like Frustum() function.
        </p>
        <p>
        The <code>fScale</code> and <code>farPlane</code> variables
        will vary from one application to another, depending on how
        large the virtual world should appear in the CAVE.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>Finally, for this wall, we add a render SPU to the network node,
        add the node to the cr object and attach the network node to the
        tilesort SPU.
    <pre>
    node.AddSPU( renderspu )
    cr.AddNode( node )

    tilesortspu.AddServer( node, protocol='tcpip', port=7000 + wall )
    </pre>
    </li>
    </ul>

</ul>

<p>
To run the cavetest1.conf demo, do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Start the mothership with <code>python cavetest1.conf</code>
<li>Start four crservers (corresponding to WALL=4)
<li>Start one crappfaker
</ul>
<p>
By default, the city program is run.
Other programs, such as atlantis may be run, but the configuration file
may need some tweaking (fScale, farPlane, zTranslate, etc).
</p>



<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Second Example (cavetest2.conf)</h2>

<p>
The <code>cavetest2.conf</code> file illustrates how to render tiled
walls.
Suppose you wanted your CAVE walls to be 2048 x 2048 pixels
driven by four projectors (four Chromium network/server nodes) each
emitting a 1024 x 1024 image.
This configuration file illustrates how one would accomplish that.
</p>

<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The viewing matrix is identical for all tiles of each view.
<li>The frustum parameters are identical for all tiles of each view,
    whether specified in the Python configuration file or specified
    from within the application with glChromiumParameterv (see below).
</ul>

<p>
To run the cavetest2.conf demo, do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Start the mothership with <code>python cavetest2.conf</code>
<li>Start eight crservers (corresponding to WALL=4 and two tiles per wall)
<li>Start one crappfaker
</ul>
<p>
By default, the city program is run.
</p>



<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Third Example - Head Tracking</h2>

<p>
A CAVE equipped with head tracking hardware can adjust the projected
images depending on the user's position inside the CAVE.
Unfortunately, there's no way to achieve this effect without modifying
the application code.
</p>

<p>
With Chromium, a call to the glChromiumParametervCR() function can be
used to specify the per-server projection matrix from inside of the
application, instead of in the Python configuration file.
</p>

<p>
The following code from the Chromium city demo illustrates how to
set a unique projection matrix for each view (each network/server node).
</p>

<pre>
static void MultiFrustum(void)
{
   int i;
   for (i = 0; i < NumViews; i++) {
      const float fSize = 1.1;
      GLfloat f[7];
      float eyex, eyez;
      float angle = (90.0 * i) * M_PI / 180.0; /* angle in radians */

      /* Each view is another 90 degree rotation about the Y axis */
      /* Compute the eye position in the rotated view */
      eyex = cos(angle) * EyeX - sin(angle) * EyeZ;
      eyez = sin(angle) * EyeX + cos(angle) * EyeZ;

      f[0] = i; /* the server */
      /* Skew the view frustum according to eye position (i.e. the
       * person's position in the cave.
       * XX This is also where we'd specify an interocular distance for stereo.
       */
      f[1] = -fSize - eyex;  /* left */
      f[2] =  fSize - eyex;  /* right */
      f[3] = -fSize - EyeY;  /* bottom */
      f[4] =  fSize - EyeY;  /* top */
      f[5] =  fSize - eyez;  /* near */
      f[6] = 100.0;          /* far */
      glChromiumParametervCR_ptr(GL_SERVER_FRUSTUM_CR, GL_FLOAT, 7, f);
   }
}
</pre>

<p>
When the application detects a change in head position, the MultiFrustum()
function would be called in place of the normal OpenGL code to specify the
projection matrix.
</p>

<p>
The sample code above is meant to be used with the cavetest1.conf or
cavetest2.conf example configurations.
Specifically, each wall (server) is rotated 90 degrees from its neighbor.
Each frustum is skewed according to the eye position within the CAVE.
</p>

<p>
The MultiFrustum() function is only example code and may need quite a
few modifications to work in other applications.
</p>

<p>
The global variables EyeX, EyeY, EyeZ are the user's eye position within
the CAVE.
</p>

<p>
The per-server projection matrix is set by calling
<code>glChromiumParametervCR(GL_SERVER_FRUSTUM_CR, GL_FLOAT, 7, m)</code>
where m[0] is the server index and m[1] through m[6] are the desired
frustum left, right, bottom, top, near, far parameters.
</p>

<p>
Alternately, an arbitrary per-server projection matrix may be set by calling
<code>glChromiumParametervCR(GL_SERVER_PROJECTION_MATRIX_CR, GL_FLOAT, 17, m)
</code>
where m[0] is the server index and m[1] through m[16] are the sixteen
elements of the projection matrix.
</p>

<p>
The per-server viewing matrix may also be set from within the application
(instead of in the Python configuration file) by calling
<code>glChromiumParametervCR(GL_SERVER_VIEW_MATRIX_CR, GL_FLOAT, 17, m)
</code>
where m[0] is the server index and m[1] through m[16] are the sixteen
elements of the viewing matrix.
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> if you specify the projection or viewing matrices in the
application with <code>glChromiumParametervCR</code> the Python
configuration file <em>should not</em> set those matrices
with the 'view_matrix' or 'projection_matrix' options.
</p>

<p>
The city demo, (run with either cavetest1.conf or cavetest2.conf) illustrates
this technique.
Press the x/X, y/Y and z/Z keys to translate the user/eye position within
the CAVE.
