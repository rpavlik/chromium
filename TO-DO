Finish up tilesort glReadPixels pixelstore parameters.

Some packed pixel formats still aren't implemented in util/pixel.c

Grep the code for 'XXX' for miscellaneous loose ends.

Convert the last Perl script in scripts/fastdep.pl to Python.

In state_polygon_gen.c in crStatePolygonSwitch() we need a better test
for updating the polygon stipple.  As-is we're calling diff.PolygonStipple
all the time.

Separate auto-start controls for server and app nodes.

Don't require a program argument in sort-last template.

Sort-last template seems to require all command line args, instead of none.

Wes Bethel:
  While driving the GUI config tool, I started out with a tilesort
  template. On the app node, I added an array SPU before the tilesort
  spu, then save the config file. The config file doesn't contain the
  array spu I asked for. There may be related problems for other
  app-side SPU additions - I've not checked.

Remove #include <math.h> ; create a cr_math.h file instead.

Rewrite the opengl_stub/defs.py file so that we don't need to manually
update the stack_sizes array.  The sizes should be obtained by calling
apiutil.PacketLength() or something similar.

Check unpacker/unpack.c for unfinished special case functions.
