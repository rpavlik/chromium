Finish up tilesort glReadPixels pixelstore parameters.

Some packed pixel formats still aren't implemented in util/pixel.c

Grep the code for 'XXX' for miscellaneous loose ends.

Convert the last two Perl scripts in scripts/fastdep.pl and
state_tracker/gendiffcode.pl to Python.

Separate auto-start controls for server and app nodes.

  While driving the GUI config tool, I started out with a tilesort
  template. On the app node, I added an array SPU before the tilesort
  spu, then save the config file. The config file doesn't contain the
  array spu I asked for. There may be related problems for other
  app-side SPU additions - I've not checked.
