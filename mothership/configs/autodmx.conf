#
# This configuration file is meant to be used with DMX.
# When everything's set up correctly, you can just type type name of your
# OpenGL app and Chromium will work automatically on your DMX display.
# This is far nicer than manually starting crservers!
#
# Prerequisites:
#  1. Your ~/.crconfigs file needs to be setup.  Specifically, it needs a
#     line like this:
#        *  /usr/local/Chromium/cr/mothership/configs/autodmx.conf %m %p
#     This tells Chromium's libcrfaker to use the autodmx.conf config file
#     when running any application (indicated by *).  The %m is replaced by
#     a random mothership port.  The %p is replaced by the program name.
#
#  2. libGL.so and libGL.so.1 must be symlink to libcrfaker.so
#
#  3. The back-end/cluster machines must have the crserver binary in the
#     search path (typically /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin) and a properly
#     set LD_LIBRARY_PATH (you can tweak it below).
#
#  4. rsh to the back-end/cluster machines must work.
#
# How it works:
#  1. When the app starts, libcrfaker will fail to find the mothership on
#     its first try.  That'll signal it to search the .crconfigs file for
#     a mothership config to spawn.  libcrfaker will choose a random port
#     number for the mothership.
#
#  2. The mothership is spawned with autodmx.conf.  In turn, it uses rsh
#     to start up the crservers on the back-end machines.  Another random
#     port number is used for the crservers.
#
#  3. Control returns to libcrfaker where it proceeds to load the client-side
#     SPU chain (tilesort).  Then, control returns to the application.
#
# Notes:
#  1. We use random port numbers (within a reasonable range) so that multiple
#     GL apps can use DMX/Chromium simultaneously.  If we don't use random
#     numbers we'd need some sort of port broker (complicated).
#
#  2. You will need to tweak 'crdir' here:

# Change this line to the location of your Chromium installation.
#crdir = "/home/sourceforge/Chromium-dmx/cr"
crdir = "/g/g16/ahern/work/Chromium/trunk/cr"
